            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>Muntinlupa Cosmopolitan School was established through the initiative of the husband and wife team, the late Mr. Ernesto A. Tepaurel and Mrs. Maria Concepcion R. Tepaurel.
            Inspired by the guidance of the Holy Spirit and heartfelt commitment to education, the couple envisioned to build a school that will cater to the academic needs of the youth of Muntinlupa City and its neighboring towns.
            On May 25, 1997 the school was inaugurated with the presence of the then Honorable Mayor Ignacio R. Bunye of Muntinlupa. Distinguished guests and visitors present during the ceremonies said a little precipitation and abundant blessings 
            from the Lord. His Eminence, Rev. Fr. Roberto Espenilla, officiated the blessing of the two-storey building built at five million pesos as a start.
            The school started with Nursery to Grade IV on its first year. Because of its quality teaching, good location and facilities, its enrolment increased and its high school classes were added during the second and third years of operation.
            It is the dream and hope of the tireless couple to spearhead the construction of more classrooms to house more students in the near future
            With the vision and courage of Mrs. Maria Concepcion R. Tepaurel, Muntinlupa Cosmopolitan School will grow into one of the quality schools of the future that will produce graduates who are ready to face the challenges of the third millennium.</p>
